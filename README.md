- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @mcdonald-conor
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in govtech, healthtech, defence and entrepeneurship. Experienced in Full Stack Development and Product Engineering.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working as a Software Engineer in Embedded Systems using C++. I like to build my ideas in Ruby on Rails and most recently, Flutter. I'm also tinkering with AI and Python to create helpful chatbots for my colleagues.

A longer term goal of mine is to create an Embedded Systems Engineer Handbook for non-engineering graduates like me. Great comprehensive resources exist but I'm looking to curate an opinionated resource relevant to my career-switching experience.
